					Dear FirstName, </p> <p>
                       Some kids just aren't crust lovers. In Flint, Michigan, brothers Sam and Josh were sharing a sandwich, fruit and milk. 
                       The younger brother, Sam, sliced off his sandwich crust and looked around for a trash can. </p>
                  <p>
                  	Before Sam could toss the crust, Josh stopped his brother, saying, <i>"Tomorrow's Saturday. Save your crust, so that we can have it for breakfast. 
                  	We'll dip it in water and have a good breakfast together."</i> The younger boy heeded his brother's advice  and stuffed the bread crust into his pocket. 
				</p>
				<p> Hearing this story breaks my heart because, I know 
				<span class="messagef">  we can do better for kids like Sam and Josh. And that's where you come in. </span> </p> </div> <!..message..>
                 <div class="messagef">

						This summer, we have a goal to raise $100,000 - enough to help us connect hungry kids to 1,000,000 meals. 
						<a href="https://secure.strength.org/site/Donation2?df_id=8240&8240.donation=form1&s_src=Web&s_subsrc=summer"> For every $1 you give, the Arby's Foundation will match your gift with $1, doubling the power of your gift. </a> 
					</p>
					<p>
						Supporters like you are funding summer meals programs in places like Flint, where Sam and Josh live. No Kid Hungry community partner, the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan, is providing summer meals at 50 sites throughout Flint -- and now they run 27 backpack sites in the area, too. 
						Every Friday, these sites give a backpack full of food to each child. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Summer meals programs like these can help save summer for children like Sam and Josh-and your gift makes it all possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						The best part is that the Arby's Foundation is matching every dollar you give to No Kid Hungry this summer, up to $100,000. 
						That means we can double our impact and help connect kids to 2,000,000 meals! Please give as much as you can afford today.
					</p>
					<p>
						With you on the No Kid Hungry team, I know we can end childhood hunger!
					</p>
					<p>
